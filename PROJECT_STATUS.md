# Plan to Complete web-user-app

## Notes
- Project is a pnpm monorepo with Next.js app in `apps/web-user-app`.
- No `pnpm-workspace.yaml` found, but monorepo works via root `package.json`.
- `web-user-app` structure: has `pages` (Cart, Home, Orders, Product, Profile, Wallet), but `services` directory is empty.
- Dependencies are installed and up to date.
- Need to avoid duplicate modules; integrate with existing core/features as per user rules.
- Backend API endpoints identified in backend/src/routes (products, orders, users, wallet, etc.).
- Backend runs on port 3001; API base URL is http://localhost:3001/api
- Axios and SWR are available in frontend dependencies.
- Centralized API client (api.js) created in utils.
- Product service (product.service.js) implemented in services.
- User service (user.service.js) implemented in services for profile API calls.
- Order service (order.service.js) implemented in services for order API calls.
- Profile, Orders, and Wallet pages fully implemented and integrated using respective services.
- Collapsible sidebar layout and minimalist black/white theme are now enforced across the app.
- ProductCard component and products listing page being created, as Product page was empty and no reusable UI components were found.
- Header, Footer, and MainLayout components being created to provide consistent app structure.
- Product detail page ([id].jsx) being created to complete product browsing flow.
- Cart functionality is managed client-side using Redux and redux-persist (no backend cart API endpoints found); cart slice and store setup in progress.
- Cart page UI and Redux connection implemented; users can now add, update, and remove cart items.
- Backend contains Review.js model; review infrastructure may exist or be partially implemented. Next step: check for review-related endpoints and plan frontend integration for attribution/timestamps.
- Backend review service (review.service.js), controller, route, and API endpoints for reviews are now implemented and mounted in products routes.
- Frontend review service integration started in web-user-app/services.
- Product detail page now displays and allows user-attributed, timestamped reviews (frontend integration complete).
- Project README.md created in apps/web-user-app; documentation and tracked changes complete.
- Monorepo includes a shared/types package with TypeScript models for all core entities (product, review, order, user, etc.).
- TypeScript is now installed and configured in web-user-app; tsconfig.json created and dependencies added.
- All core frontend services (product, user, order, wallet, review) refactored to use shared types via JSDoc annotations for type safety.
- Profile and Orders pages migrated to TypeScript using shared types.
- Order detail page ([id].tsx) migration to TypeScript complete.
- Wallet page migration to TypeScript complete.
- ProductCard component and products listing page migrated to TypeScript and shared types.
- Product detail page ([id].tsx) migration to TypeScript complete.
- Cart page and CartItem component migrated to TypeScript and shared types.
- CollapsibleSidebar, MainLayout, and AppLayout migrated to TypeScript.
- Header and Footer components migrated to TypeScript and minimalist theme.
