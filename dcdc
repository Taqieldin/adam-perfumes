Project Overview: Adam-Perfumes E-Commerce Ecosystem
Adam-Perfumes is a leading perfume brand based in the Sultanate of Oman, operating 21 physical branches across the country. The goal of this project is to design and develop a complete, scalable, and multilingual digital ecosystem to elevate Adam-Perfumes into a modern, customer-focused, and technology-driven retail brand.

This ecosystem includes a fully integrated e-commerce website, mobile applications (iOS & Android) for customers, dedicated admin applications, and a centralized backend system that controls all business operations. The platform utilizes Firebase for mobile backend services and leverages shared hosting (e.g., ChemiCloud) for deploying the website and backend APIs.

Key Components
Customer Mobile App (Android & iOS)
A user-friendly app designed for shoppers to browse, purchase, and interact with the brand seamlessly. Key features include bilingual support (Arabic & English), online payments, order tracking, in-app wallet, reward points, chat support, and personalized notifications.

Admin Mobile App (Android & iOS)
A mobile application specifically for store administrators and managers to control inventory, manage products and orders, send promotions, and monitor sales performance remotely in real-time.

E-Commerce Website
A responsive and modern web platform that mirrors the mobile app functionality, allowing users to browse and purchase products, manage accounts, and access promotions. It supports seamless login and synchronization between web and mobile platforms.

Backend System (Hosted on ChemiCloud)
Built with Node.js and Express, the backend serves as the central hub for managing products, users, orders, payments, and analytics. It integrates with Firebase for user authentication, cloud messaging, real-time database management, and storage.

Firebase Integration
Firebase is used for authentication, database (Firestore), storage, push notifications (FCM), real-time updates, and AI features like automated chat replies using ChatGPT (optional).
